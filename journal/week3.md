# Cognito configuration

I've created the user pool according to the configurations determined on the live stream:

After creating the environment variables on docker-compose.yml (we are not using Identity Pools), i've modified the App.js file and setting them up on the Amplify.configure function: 

````
Amplify.configure({
  "AWS_PROJECT_REGION": process.env.REACT_APP_AWS_PROJECT_REGION,
  "aws_cognito_region": process.env.REACT_APP_AWS_COGNITO_REGION,
  "aws_user_pools_id": process.env.REACT_APP_AWS_USER_POOLS_ID,
  "aws_user_pools_web_client_id": process.env.REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID,
  "oauth": {},
  Auth: {

    region: process.env.REACT_APP_AWS_PROJECT_REGION,
    userPoolId: process.env.REACT_APP_AWS_USER_POOLS_ID,        
    userPoolWebClientId: process.env.REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID,
  }
});
````

### Sign-in

Obtaining the following error on the sign-in as expected:

However, after doing the 'user creation' i've received a similar error by console:

So, we fixed it by using the following command to force the user confirmation

````
aws cognito-idp admin-set-user-password --user-pool-id  us-east-1_59FptcUv8 --username camilol --password Testing1234! --permanent
````

Then we are authenticated, making sure the name and preffered username values are configured for our first user:

### Sign-up

I received the confirmation code on my inbox and put it on the confirmation page:

### Recover password 

After confirming i was able to signing up with the OTP, i also was bale to get the recovery code:

Honestly, i am falling behind right now and i'll love to do the review of the code and make the confirmation page look prettier:

### JWT on the back-end

I validated the JWT was generated correctly:
