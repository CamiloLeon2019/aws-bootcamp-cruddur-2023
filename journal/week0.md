# Week 0 — Billing and Architecture

Hello Andrew (or whoever is reviewing this)

It's my first time using and editing this file text, so i just had to look up on the internet what the heck is a markdown file and i found it very easily on <a href=https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/websites/web-development/what-is-a-md-file/>IONOS<a>. 

Now, i understand this would be the journal for every new progress that i have for the project so i'll try to document everything as far as i can. I was part of the live session last Saturday along with Margaret, Shala, Chris and you. I had a great time learning on how the project is going to be and understanding the value of the cloud onto this. I was at my job time back then and the day after, so just now i have the time to review all the documentation available, such as the project outline.
  
I already ahve some of the pre requisite knowldege and technologies (aws and github account) and i am reading everything to make sure i am up-to-date. I know that this is part of the homework challenges for this week so here is my IAM portal showing my admin account for my playersslayer96's aws account.

 I am also part of a study group (not a team) which it is very useful to catch up besides the official discord group.

 To be honest, i feel excited and overwhelmed at the same time with so much stuff to watch and the time available for me, but i see this as a great challenge for me. 
 
  <h1> Homework journal </h1>
  
  The first task has already been done last Saturday along with you and i have some great takeaways from the classs, such as the general scope of the project, stakeholders, goals, methodology as well asimportant knowlegde to acquire throughout the whole bootcamp.

  I have reviewed this as part of the AWS-CLF-C01 video of Andrew (big thanks to him for my certification) a couple of months ago, it was great to know how i can be spend and wasting money at some point if i don't use my budget and billing tools available. When entering to my billing dashboard i received a disclaimer that there were some IAM policies being updated, however my IAM user didn't need any update at all. I created my aws account around 6 months ago and haven't used it since the certification. I had EC2 and Cloudwatch services running with no charges (thank god!)

While reviewing Chirag's video iwas not able to get billing information for my IAM account correctly so i had to llo up for AWS documentation for help on this and i found <a href=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_billing.html?icmpid=docs_iam_console#tutorial-billing-step1/>this<a> which was very helpful.
