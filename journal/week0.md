# Week 0 ‚Äî Billing and Architecture

Hello Andrew (or whoever is reviewing this)

It's my first time using and editing this file text, so i just had to look up on the internet what the heck is a markdown file and i found it very easily on <a href=https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/websites/web-development/what-is-a-md-file/>IONOS<a>. However i've noticed that this can be used so much better buy checking other's markdown file as a table of contents, so here it is:
  
 ## Contents table

- [Pre-requisites](#pre-requisites).
- [Budget](#budget) 
- [Cloudwatch billing alarm](#cloudwatch-billing-alarm)
- [Logical Architectural diagram](#logical-architectural-diagram).
- [Draft & conceptual diagram](#conceptual-architectural-diagram).
- [AWS Organizations account](#aws-organizations-account).

 ## Pre-requisites
  
Now, i understand this would be the journal for every new progress that i have for the project so i'll try to document everything as far as i can. I was part of the live session last Saturday along with Margaret, Shala, Chris and you. I had a great time learning on how the project is going to be and understanding the value of the cloud onto this. I was at my job time back then and the day after, so just now i have the time to review all the documentation available, such as the project outline.
  
I already have some of the pre requisite knowldege and technologies (aws and github account) and i am reading everything to make sure i am up-to-date.

 I know that this is part of the homework challenges for this week so here is my IAM portal showing my admin account for my aws account.

 To be honest, i feel excited and overwhelmed at the same time with so much stuff to watch and the time available for me, but i see this as a great challenge for me. 
The first task has already been done last Saturday along with you and i have some great takeaways from the classs, such as the general scope of the project, stakeholders, goals, methodology as well asimportant knowlegde to acquire throughout the whole bootcamp.

  <h2> Spend considerations ü§ë </h2> 
  
 I have reviewed this as part of the AWS-CLF-C01 video of Andrew (big thanks to him for my certification) a couple of months ago, it was great to know how i can be spend and wasting money at some point if i don't use my budget and billing tools available. When entering to my billing dashboard i received a disclaimer that there were some IAM policies being updated, however my IAM user didn't need any update at all. I created my aws account around 6 months ago and haven't used it since the certification. I had EC2 and Cloudwatch services running with no charges (thank god!)

While reviewing Chirag's video i was not able to get billing information for my IAM account correctly so i had to look up for AWS documentation for help on this and i found this article which was very helpful: (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_billing.html?icmpid=docs_iam_console#tutorial-billing-step1)
  
## Budget

I configured the Cloudwatch billing alarm and recieve my first notification üòé

Watching the video was useful to see the how much money i've spent and i hope that by the end of this project my spent is as unexpensive as possible.

  <h2> Cloud Security üîè </h2>
  
  Watching an hour video seems interesting for me, however some concepts reviewd on the CLF-C01 cert course, such as IAM, but this Cloud security concept is something 'll definetily look into from now on. I think that services, data and app that is cloud-enabled is even more vulnerable to attacks as there are more attack surfaces being publicly available and even private.
  
## AWS organizations account

I've done already the MFA for my root and IAM admin account, so i just did a refresher there and created my AWS Organizations account:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49325152/218816274-a694a4fc-e041-4074-915d-116dab6476a7.png)
  
Moving forward, I've reviewed the AWS Cloudtrail functionalities and how benefitial it is for logging and visiility of historical data. Following along Ashish cloudtrail logs creation, i created mine and i was relieved to see that creating this trail has <a href=https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/pricing//>no additional charges <a>

IAM users, roles, groups and policies have been checkd for my account as part of the certification course, so i had that already covered, anyways it's a great refresher. 
 
 I've copied the recommended CSPs provided by Ashish:

It was difficult for me to understand the difference between regular policies and SCPs, but the general idea of the policies was understood and i really like the concept of configuring and managing them (as well as many other AWS services). 
 
  <h2> Diagrams üëÄ </h2>

## Logical-architectural-diagram 
      
 I have been doing the logical diagram along with Andrew, understanding the best practices that are required when doing a diagram for an application or a service:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49325152/219768111-e5c1e669-f1dc-466f-98c4-f8309bd8ca74.png)

Watching Andrew's video was very useful to know how to get external shapes and i liked how he was able to manage to get the svg for the momento service. Here is the link for my LucidChart diagram: https://lucid.app/lucidchart/d37f4bba-65b7-4bfd-b68d-3b22cb64a4fe/edit?viewport_loc=-444%2C20%2C2994%2C1430%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_9118be86-9d3c-4473-985d-0db5c08eafdc

  I understood that the napkin design and the actual napkin drawing was for this design so here is the one that i did (i hope its undestandable):

## Conceptual-architectural-diagram
  
 The conceptual diagram was much easier to perform and i just copied directly from the original one and using the shapes that came by default on the LucidChart application, so here it's the design ad it's link:
