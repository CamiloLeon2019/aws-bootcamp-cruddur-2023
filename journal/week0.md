# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

Hello Andrew (or whoever is reviewing this)

It's my first time using and editing this file text, so i just had to look up on the internet what the heck is a markdown file and i found it very easily on <a href=https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/websites/web-development/what-is-a-md-file/>IONOS<a>. 

Now, i understand this would be the journal for every new progress that i have for the project so i'll try to document everything as far as i can. I was part of the live session last Saturday along with Margaret, Shala, Chris and you. I had a great time learning on how the project is going to be and understanding the value of the cloud onto this. I was working back then and the day after, so just now i have the time to review all the documentation available, such as the project outline.
  
I already ahve some of the pre requisite knowldege and technologies (aws and github account) and i am reading everything to make sure i am up-to-date, i am also part of a study group (not a team) which it is very useful to catch up besides the official discord group.
