## Settign up Honeycomb

I watched Shala's video before this week as part of the prereqs for the ACBP (AWS Cloud Bootcampo Project), so i generated the API Key and enabled it on the gp env variables:

Once the API key was set, I was able to obtain information from Honeycomb without too much context at the very beginning:

It was great to know i was able to obtain data from the app to Honeycomb (at least without a context). Now after providing some context to it with a trace using:

````
from opentelemetry import trace

tracer = trace.get_tracer("home.activities")

````

We are able to get multiple traces, however we need to provide even more context, so we use:

````
with tracer.start_as_current_span("mock-data"):
````

With this we are able to get general data from the home dashboard and we can apply the same to other dashboards as well:

## Adding custom spans

I've added a custom span using the same logic as the one used for the app.now and result.lenght spans. I have done it on the notifications_activities.py to get it on a different dashboard:

````
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("home-notifications-mock-data"):
      span = trace.get_current_span()
    now = datetime.now(timezone.utc).astimezone()
    results = [{
      'uuid': '68f126b0-1ceb-4a33-88be-d90fa7109eee',
      'handle': 'Camilo Leon',
 
 ...
    span.set_attribute("app.user_name", results[0]['handle'])
    return results
````

However, i do not get the username string span as i planned:
